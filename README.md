- Mean Score by Activity

The demographics dashboard provides visualizations of:
- Student Gender Bar Charts
- Learner Gender Bar Charts
- Student Gender Distribution by Campus
- Learner Gender Distribution by Campus
- Learner Gender Distribution by Age
- Learner Age Histogram
- Student Class Histogram
- Student Section Histogram

To use the files, change the paths to the data files as indicated at the top of the files. 

In demographicsDashboard.py, you will need to change the file paths h5p_activity_path, student_data_path, learner_data_path, request_data_path to the file paths of the respective data sets. 

In performanceDashboard.py, you will need to change the file paths h5p_activity_path to the file path of the h5p activity dataset. 

You might need to open the chrome independently if the server does not launch itself. The link should appear in your terminal.
